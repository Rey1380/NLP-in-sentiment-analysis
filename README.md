# NLP-in-sentiment-analysis
In this project we have used 2000 labeled dataset to train different models for sentiment analysis. <br />
This dataset contains 2000 tweets and we have labeled these dataset after detecting each  <br />
tweet sentiment(0 for positive, 1 for neutral and 2 for negative sentiment).
At last we have evaluated each model on our test dataset and we have reported their performance on our test dataset.
